# PeaceSleep
## Introduction
A sleep aid app.

The feature of this app is that it can use curves to schedule volume changes over time. Typically, you might want a sleep aid app where the volume gradually decreases over time.

This app is designed to run on embedded-devices, but you are free to adapt it to any devices for your need.
